		<h1> Brisket Basics </h1>
			<p> Slow cooking brisket is a rich and rewarding experience for all levels of at-home smokers. Below are several tips for stepping your smoking game up! </p>
		<h3> Getting Started </h3>
			<p> First, you will need to acquire your meat. Certified Angus Beef is a sure fire way to get the taste you crave. </p>
		<h6> Seasoning </h6>
			<p> A good Texas-style dry rub is made up of mostly kosher salt and ground black pepper. From there, the choice is up to the individual what accent spices to use. Paprika makes a great addition for example! </p>

		MEAT JOHN LEWIS A master of barbecue, John Lewis never cuts corners, unless you’re talking about burnt ends of course. The pitmaster’s cult-like following can be attributed to his unerring dedication to barbecue – from welding his own custom-designed smokers to waking up at 4 a.m. to tend to the fire, he takes his meat seriously. Barbecue enthusiasts have flocked to his pits for years, waiting in long lines to get a taste of his expertly smoked pork spareribs, beef ribs, “Texas hot guts” sausage, oxtail and his legendary beef brisket.
