		<h1> Brisket Basics </h1>
			<p> Slow cooking brisket is a rich and rewarding experience for all levels of at-home smokers. Below are several tips for stepping your smoking game up! </p>
		<h3> Getting Started </h3>
			<p> First, you will need to acquire your meat. Certified Angus Beef is a sure fire way to get the taste you crave. </p>
		<h6> Seasoning </h6>
			<p> A good Texas-style dry rub is made up of mostly kosher salt and ground black pepper. From there, the choice is up to the individual what accent spices to use. Paprika makes a great addition for example! </p>
